# synology-minecraft-bedrock

This is a Docker-based distribution of Bedrock Minecraft wrapped for deployment to Synology.

We essentially wrap Geoff Bourne's work at https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-bedrock-server with slight changes to config.

New versions should release in Geoff's updates in docker, or any dependency updates.
